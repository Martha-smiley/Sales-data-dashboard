## Project Insight
- In 2015, the sub-Saharan African region made the highest profit (about 131 million).
- Baby food is consumed more in Africa compared to Europe.
- The middle east and north Africa made the least profit through the online sales channel.
- Certain products such as personal care, beverages and office supplies were ordered and consumed more therefore contribute more to the overall revenue and profit.
- Europe generated the most revenue while the sub-Saharan generated the most in 2014.

## Conclusion
In countries with low profit generations, a detailed tailored marketing and sales strategy for each region should be developed considering customers specific needs and preferences, behaviors and demographics to help generate revenue. Also, countries/regions that generate the least profit though the online sales channel, options like strengthen the offline sales channels such as retail stores and distributor can be consider as part of the new strategy as well as investing more on the online sales channel.
